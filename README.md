## Features

### 1. Open Multiple Signals

- You can open multiple medical signals simultaneously to analyze and compare them.

### 2. Zoom In and Out

- Easily zoom in and out of signal data to focus on specific timeframes and details.

### 3. Hide Specific Signals

- You can hide specific signals to simplify the visualization and focus on relevant data.

### 4. Two Graphs

- The program provides two separate graphs for comparing different signals side by side.

### 5. Move Signals Between Graphs

- You can move signals from one graph to another for comparison and analysis.

### 6. Link Button

- The link button allows you to synchronize the two graphs. When linked, any operations you perform on one graph (e.g., zooming, hiding signals) will be mirrored on the other graph.
